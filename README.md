# NoEyeForDesign
Hackathon project

“No Eye for Design” is a webpage that aims to be the worst website ever. The purpose of the webpage is to have the WORST user interface and experience. The project will consist of a pre-built landing page for the site, an information webpage explaining the purpose of the website, and an introduction page that will explain introductory topics of UX/UI with the worst design choices I can muster up within four hours. The landing and information pages were developed prior to the hackathon 2/16/23.
